# CODE BOOK

##Subject, Activity

  * __Subject_ID__: Integer variable between 1 and 30 representing the subject's ID.
  * __Activity__: Character variable describing the activity. The 6 activities are:
    * Walking
    * Walking Upstairs
    * Walking Downstairs
    * Laying
    * Sitting
    * Standing

## Meaurement means
The next 79 variables are numerics between -1 and 1. They represent the mean of a subject's activity for different measured features.
